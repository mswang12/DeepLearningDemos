## GAN Evaluation
https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-evaluate-generative-adversarial-networks/

## Current Plan
- How can we evaluate the results? Not just qualitative, but also quantitatively. (John)
- Find out what GAN data can be used?...function, or different training method. (John)
- 30 minutes blog post tutorial write up framework (Wiley, Mike)
- Review ICCV papers (Mike, Wiley)
- Pull out functions (SinGAN.training.train_single_scale) and models (models.GeneratorConcatSkip2CleanAdd and models.WDiscriminator) to re-implement from SinGAN (Mike)
- Run DoubleGAN on more images (Mike)

## Specific Interesting Architectures
Note:
1. Hour glass
1. U-net
1. Dense-net/Resnet
1. Mobilenet v3
1. SqueezeNet

## ICCV
ICCV: http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/program/main_conference#poster11
1. Plan is to summarize ICCV and present to group
